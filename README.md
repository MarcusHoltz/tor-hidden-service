# Create a Tor network hidden service using a vanity .onion address with Docker

* * *

## Using Tor to host an .onion service

The purpose of this repo is to give someone a chance to test out hosting an [.onion hidden service](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/setup/).

You can use this to quickly share a service to a friend, client, or even your future self.

> A Tor hidden service does not need your server to have open ports or port forwarding - because it does not accept direct inbound connections from the public internet. Instead, both the client and the hidden service connect outbound to the Tor network, establishing circuits to special relays called introduction and rendezvous points. All communication is routed through these Tor relays, so as long as your server can make outbound connections to the Tor network, it can host a hidden service!

## 1-up-tor-onion-address script

[The 1-up-tor-onion-address.sh script](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) sets up **one** service that will be available through a [Tor .onion address](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion).

> This service is only available through the Tor network

This is intended as a demonstration. I hope you're able to learn and enjoy using. If you'd like more information head over to the [Holtzweb Blog post](https://blog.holtzweb.com/posts/tor-network-hidden-service-vanity-website-setup-with-docker/).

* * *

### Script Requirements

The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script will need `sudo`. 

Sudo is required to set all of the directory permissions correctly. 

You will then need docker installed to generate a vanity address and run the `docker-compose.yml` file that starts up Tor.

The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script is only intended to prepare the environment we're using with Docker.


* * *

### Changes the Script makes

The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script sets up two directories, a file, and optionally a vanity address.


#### Two Directories

You need sudo privs for:

- tor_config/vanity_keys/

and

- tor_data/

> Those directories store the keys that are used for your .onion address. Kept safe from any normal user.



#### A file: torrc

A [torrc file](https://support.torproject.org/glossary/torrc/) contains all the settings Tor uses. 

You need sudo privs for:

- tor_config/torrc

> By changing this file we can tell Tor what services we want to serve on a Tor Hidden Service and where to find the corresponding .onion address.


* * *

## Vanity Name Creation

A [vanity address](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/vanity-addresses/) is an onion address that starts with a pre-chosen number of characters, usually a meaningful name related to a specific Onion Service. 

For instance, one might try to generate an onion address for the mysitename website and end up with something looking like this:

`mysitenameyx4fi3l6x2gyzmtmgxjyqyorj9qsb5r543izcwymle.onion`

This has some advantages:

- It is easy for Onion Services users to know which site they are about to access.

- It has some branding appeal to site owners.

- It is easy for Onion Services operators to debug their logs and know which services have errors.

- Anyone else is very unlikely to come up with the exact key from the example above, but they may be able to find a similar key - one beginng with the same few letters. 

  - The longer the vanity name length, the less likly it is to have a forgery made.


* * *

### Vanity Name Length

You can only pick something, at max, 7 characters.

> Why?

Let's say you were running this on a Raspberry Pi 2B....

Take a look at the approximate generation time per character for a Raspberry Pi 2B below:

#### Approximate Generation Time per Character Count Chart

```text
Vanity Characters : Approximate Generation Time
1  : <1 second
2  : <1 second
3  : 1 second
4  : 30 seconds
5  : 16 minutes
6  : 8.5 hours
7  : 11.5 days
8  : 1 year
9  : 32 years
10 : 1,024 years
11 : 32,768 years
12 : 1 million years
```

### How is the vanity generated

Thanks to the work on the [cathugger/mkp224o](https://github.com/cathugger/mkp224o) repository, we're able to generate vanity address for tor onion v3 (ed25519) hidden services.

- Specifically, the [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script will run: `docker run ghcr.io/cathugger/mkp224o:master -n 3 <your_vanity_name>`

- It will generate `3` .onion addresses that begin with your vanity name, allowing you to select a favorite.

- The .onion address will be in `tor_config/vanity_keys/`


### Can't I just use my own .onion address

Yes! The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script will prompt you to use your own, you just have to provide the path.


#### Instructions for Using Bringing Your Own Vanity Tor Address:

1. Make sure you have all of your files for your .onion address in the same directory:

   - `hostname` - Contains your .onion address

   - `hs_ed25519_secret_key` - Your private key

   - `hs_ed25519_public_key` - Your public key


2. After the [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script completes, verify your hidden service is correct:

```bash

sudo cat tor_data/hidden_service/hostname

```


* * *

## What Service to put on Tor

You will also need a service to provide to the .onion address. 

This can be anything. It can be another docker container, a python web server on your laptop, your favorite IoT device, whatever!

You will just need to give The [1-up-tor-onion-address.sh](https://github.com/MarcusHoltz/tor-hidden-service/blob/main/1-up-tor-onion-address.sh) script:

- The `IP` or `Hostname` of the service you're sending to the Tor network.

- The `Port` for the service to forward over the .onion address.

- ONLY ONE SERVICE!!!    --> tor_data/hidden_service/

> This script is designed for demonstration and as such, there's only one service designed into the script. You can always make multiple services on the same .onion address with different ports, or a new .onion address for every service. But today, only one service.


* * *

### Sample Service

If you really dont have anything to use as a service, you can create a quick HTTP server with bash:

- Creates an HTTP server using `netcat`

- Server will respond on `port 5432`

- Exit the netcat command with: `ctrl + c`

```bash

echo -e "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<p>Works for me</p><p>$(date)</p>" | nc -l -p 5432

```

> Add an `&` on the end to the command - to let in run in the background.

> Exit from the background with: `kill $(ps -ef | grep [5]432 | awk '{print $2'})`


* * *

## Torrc is important

The `torrc` file lets you define `HiddenServiceDir` and `HiddenServicePort` directives, these tell Tor where to store your service you're sending to the Tor network's keys and what ports to forward, making your .onion site accessible.


* * *

## The 1-up-tor-onion-address.sh script uses two directories

File permissions are critical for Tor hidden services:
   - Directories need 700 permissions (drwx------)
   - Key files need 600 permissions (-rw-------)
   - The docker container will adjusts these permissions for you

The Tor user (not root) must own all these files inside the container


* * *

## Browsers that find an onion service

- Use [Brave Browser](https://support.brave.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018121491-What-is-a-Private-Window-with-Tor-Connectivity)

- Use [Tor Browser](https://support.torproject.org/)

## Uninstall

How do you stop the Tor network and remove this demonstration? 

- To uninstall, delete the directory (tor-hidden-service-main) you created for this demonstration (you may have to use sudo) and run the following to remove the docker container:

```bash

docker stop $(docker ps -a | grep tor-hidden-service | awk '{print $1}') 2>/dev/null && docker rm $(docker ps -a | grep tor-hidden-service | awk '{print $1}') 2>/dev/null

```

- Done!


* * *

## Why the name 1-up-tor-onion-address script?

It sets `up` only `one` service, available through a `tor .onion address`.
